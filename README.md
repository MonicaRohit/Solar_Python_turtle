** Solar System Simulation
This Python program simulates a basic solar system using the Turtle graphics library. The program models the sun and several planets, each moving in elliptical orbits around the sun.

Features
Realistic elliptical orbits for planets.
Sun and planets are represented with Turtle graphics.
Simulates gravitational interactions between the sun and planets.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Turtle graphics library

How to Run
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-system-simulation.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd solar-system-simulation
```

Run the simulation:
```bash
python solar.py
```
The simulation window will appear, and you can observe the movement of planets around the sun.
